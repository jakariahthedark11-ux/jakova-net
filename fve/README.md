# Fractal Voyager Engine (FVE) – Repo Skeleton

This folder contains the **public skeleton** for the Fractal Voyager Engine demo.

- `state-schema.v0.json` – draft JSON schema for a universe.
- `examples/` – sample universes (starting with `tiny_local_cosmos.json`).

The actual Python and Unity code currently live on a local machine.
Once the interfaces stabilise, public code will be added or linked here.

If you want to understand how the state works, start with:

- `state-schema.v0.json`
- `examples/tiny_local_cosmos.json`
- `docs/fractal-voyager-engine.md`
