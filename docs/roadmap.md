# Roadmap (High-Level)

This is a rough, non-binding roadmap. Dates are intentionally vague.

## Phase 1 – Canonical spine (now)

- [x] Public repo with README, LICENSE, CITATION
- [x] Architecture, ideology, and FVE docs
- [x] Zenodo specs for:
  - v1.0 OS
  - v2 OS (life/lab/cosmos)
  - EXAWATTS work-class
  - EBNT cross-scale theory

## Phase 2 – Demo hardening

- [ ] Finalise JSON state schema for FVE v0
- [ ] Document backend/engine interface
- [ ] Record and publish a short video of FVE running on the GL73 laptop
- [ ] Add more example universes (lab, logistics, printers)

## Phase 3 – Toolkit

- [ ] Simple CLI or script to:
  - create new universes from templates
  - validate state files
  - archive / snapshot universes
- [ ] Basic test suite for schemas and sample universes

## Phase 4 – External adapters (longer-term)

- [ ] Robotics or fabrication adapter
- [ ] Data-visualisation adapter
- [ ] Hooks for personal knowledge systems

This roadmap is deliberately conservative.  
Safety and local-first guarantees come before hype.
