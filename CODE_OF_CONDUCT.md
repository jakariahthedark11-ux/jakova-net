# Code of Conduct

This project is research-grade infrastructure for personal AI operating systems.  
The bar for behaviour is simple:

- Treat other contributors with respect.  
- Do not harass, stalk, or abuse anyone.  
- Critique ideas, not people.  
- No racism, sexism, or other bigotry – explicit or implied.  
- No doxxing, no leaking private data, no “clever” workarounds.

Disagreements about architecture, safety, or governance are welcome, **if** they are argued in good faith and backed by reasoning or evidence.

If you see behaviour that breaks this Code of Conduct, you can:

- open an issue marked `code-of-conduct`, or  
- contact the maintainer privately via the email listed in the repository profile or CITATION file.

The maintainer reserves the right to ban users or reject contributions that ignore these rules.
